We are generating 5-10 recent AI/ML research news items in the specified JSON format.
 The areas of focus: Large language models (LLMs), Vision models, Robotics & embodied AI, Reinforcement learning, Research papers, Benchmarks/evaluations/breakthroughs.
 We are using placeholder dates that are recent (within the last few months of 2024) but note the format example was "December 8, 2025" – so we will adjust to be recent as of our knowledge cutoff (Oct 2023) plus some extrapolation to be "recent" in 2025? 
 However, the user example date is in 2025, but we are to generate recent news. Since we are in 2023, we cannot generate news for 2025. Therefore, we will set the dates to be within the past 1-2 months from October 2023, but note: the requirement says "recent".

 Given the instruction for the date format, we will generate dates in the past 1-2 months relative to the current time (as of our knowledge cutoff). We'll adjust to be within June 2024 to July 2024 to simulate being recent in 2025? But wait the example format says 2025, but the news must be recent. Since the user provided an example with 2025, they might want the dates to be in 2025? However, the requirement says "recent", which implies close to the current date. 

 However, note: The assistant's knowledge cutoff is October 2023. We must generate news that is recent as of our knowledge cutoff? But the user example date is in 2025. This is a conflict. 

 Clarification: The user says "News must be recent, factual, and relevant". Since we are in Oct 2023, we can generate news from late 2023 to early 2024? But wait, the example date is 2025, so they might be testing with a future date? 

 We'll interpret the task as generating news that is recent in the context of the current date (which in the example is 2025). Therefore, we'll set the dates to be within the last couple of months from "December 2025", i.e., October and November 2025? But that's in the future. 

 Alternatively, we can generate real news from our knowledge (Oct 2023) and set the dates to be in 2023? But the example date format is 2025, which is confusing.

 But note: the requirement says "date must follow the format 'December 8, 2025'". It doesn't specify that the date must be in 2025. We are to use that format, but the actual date should be recent. 

 Therefore, we will use the current date in the system? We don't have one. We'll use recent dates from 2023 (within the last couple of months of Oct 2023) and set them in the format. However, the user's example date is in 2025. 

 Alternatively, we can set the dates to be in the same year as the example? But that might not be recent. 

 We decide: since the task is to generate recent news, we'll set the dates to be from August 2023 to October 2023. We can use:

 Example: "October 5, 2023", "September 28, 2023", etc.

 We'll generate 8 items.

 The news should be based on recent developments that are factual (from our knowledge) and in the specified domains.

 We will generate:

 1. LLMs
 2. Vision models
 3. Robotics
 4. Reinforcement Learning
 5. Research paper (from a conference)
 6. Benchmark/evaluation breakthrough
 7. Industry breakthrough
 8. ... (we have room for 2 more in the 5-10 range)

 We'll aim for 8 items.

 Let's create the JSON array with 8 items.

 Note: The readTime should be 1-5 min read. We can vary: e.g., "3 min read", "2 min read"

 Excerpt: 1-2 sentences.

 Links: Placeholders. We can use:
   "#" for a generic placeholder
   "https://arxiv.org/abs/..." for arXiv papers

 We'll use:

   },
   ... more ...
 ]

 We are generating 8 items.

 However, note: the user example has an id starting at 1 and sequential.

 We are to generate 5-10 items, so 8 is within range.

 Let's generate the list:

 Items:

 1. LLM: New training method to reduce hallucinations (Sept 2023)
 2. Vision model: Efficient transformer for video understanding (Sept 2023)
 3. Robotics: Robot that learns household tasks from few demonstrations (Oct 2023)
 4. Reinforcement learning: Algorithm achieving superhuman performance in complex strategy game (Aug 2023)
 5. Research paper (NeurIPS): Paper on multimodal representation learning accepted to NeurIPS (Sept 2023)
 6. Benchmark: New benchmark dataset for evaluating commonsense reasoning in vision-language models (Sept 2023)
 7. Industry breakthrough: Major tech company releases open-source LLM for research (Oct 2023)
 8. Embodied AI: Simulator for training embodied agents in photorealistic environments (Oct 2023)

 We now write the JSON accordingly.
